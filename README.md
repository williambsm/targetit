 This is an Open Source plugin for jQuery. It was created to simplify binding on scroll events to elements and having more flexibility over the results.

 Example of how to use the plugin:
 > <div id="scroll_div"> When this reaches the end trigger a function</div>
 > 
 > $("#scroll_div").targetIt(callback: helloWorld);
 >
